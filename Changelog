Version 5.10.7 released 12-Nov-2024
- Fixed IndirectParameterRefEntry bug not referencing the previous parameter id
- Fixed replays causing memory leaks
- Added a TimeBinaryEncoder that can encode timestamps into commands supporting time correlation (unlike the pure XTCE time encoding)

Version 5.10.6 released 7-Nov-2024
- Small tweaks and fixes related to: CFDP, web UI, algorithms

Version 5.10.5 released 24-Oct-2024
- Small tweaks and fixes related to: Parameter Archive, CCSDS frames, web UI, Mission Database

Version 5.10.4 released 15-Oct-2024
- Changed the custom RocksDB library introduced in 5.10.0 to support CPUs as old as Intel Core 2.
- Added support for XTCE IndirectParameterRefEntry
- Fixed the export buttons
- Fixed the Packet Viewer

Version 5.10.3 released 7-Oct-2024
- The alarm work done in 5.10.2 enabled by mistake the EventAlarmServer which used to be disabled by default. That causes Yamcs not to start in many configurations which used to work (including the Yamcs quickstart) due to missing the event_alarms_realtime. 
  This version restores back the old behaviour - namely the EventAlarmServer is disabled by default. 

Version 5.10.2 released 6-Oct-2024
- Improvement in command stacks: they are called simply "stacks" and allow interleaving commands with comments and steps allowing the operator to check the live value of defined parameters.
- Added event filtering.
- Alarm reloading - when Yamcs restarts it will reload the non-cleared alarms from the database such that they are active again.
- Smaller tweaks and fixes.

Version 5.10.1 released 1-Sept-2024
- Activities: Execute known script files with (configurable) external program.
- Small tweaks and fixes related to Parameter Archive and the web plugin.

Version 5.10.0 released 11-Aug-2024
- Introduced RocksDB Merge Operator for the Parameter Archive. Archives created with this version will be incompatible with older versions of Yamcs. The Parameter Archive created with older versions of Yamcs will continue working with this version (and they are backward compatible). 
 The advatange of the Merge Operator is that it requires much less memory when filling the Parameter Archive (the maxSegmentSize can be set to low values) without losing retrieval performance in the long run (RocksDB merges in the bagkround the small segments into larger intervals).
 To take advantage of this new format, a complete rebuild of the Parameter Archive is required (can be done with yamcs parameter-archive purge, yamcs parameter-archive rebuild)
- Java 17 or higher is required starting with this version
- Fixes an MDB cache issue introduce in recent releases
- File transfer list was reworked to show all transfers on a single page, with filter capability
- Various other small tweaks and fixes

Version 5.9.8 released 9-July-2024
- small tweaks and fixes related to Parameter Archive, Frame valid/invalid counters, command dispatching, parameter link configuration.

- Fix event/command text search not matching beyond limit.
- Fix extra command options not considered when scheduling command or stack.
- Fix LDAP unauthenticated bind issue when using LdapAuthModule.
- Add yamcs-web configuration option to allow displaying local times instead of UTC. Default behaviour remains UTC.
- Fix TC cascading when direct mapping was used.

Version 5.9.6 released 24-May-2024
- Allow descriptions for aggregate members defined in the spreadsheet
- Small tweaks and fixes

Version 5.9.5 released 11-May-2024
- Add CSV export for commands
- Small tweaks and fixes related to CFDP, Parameter Archive, Permissions, replication


Version 5.9.4 released 11-Apr-2024
- Implemented sparse groups in the parameter archive. This allows faster retrieval and less memory consumed during builtup and retrieval, at the expense of sliglthy higher disk usage
- Added a processor option to persist the latest parameter values, such that when Yamcs restarts, it remembers the values for all parameters with the persist flag set. In XTCE, all parameters have the flag set by default. For spreadsheets, they have to be marked specifically using the newly added 'p' flag.
- For web-rendered OPI displays, show past values on plots, in addition to realtime values
- Automatically update plots following completion of a backfill operation
- For `FilePollingTmDataLink`, add a `lastPacketStream` option, so that the last packet on a dump stream could be emitted to the realtime stream (for updating display state of connected clients)
- On `GenericPacketPreprocessor`, add a `rootContainer` option. Previously this could only be done by making a new stream.


Version 5.9.3 released 25-March-2024
- Added a yamcs parameter-archive purge operation to remove completely the parameter archive before rebuilding.
  Sometimes the rebuild does not properly remove old data resulting in duplicates (this bug will be addressed in a future release) and the purge can be run to overcome the problem.
- Added system parameters for reporting memory consumed by RocksDB
- Improve accuracy of Archive Browser display
- Improve visualization of arrays/aggregates in on-demand packet extraction result
- Update to Angular 17 - this requires minimum node version 18

Version 5.9.2 released 12-March-2024
- Tweak activity-related UI
- Fix issue with cancelling of activities
- Fix issue with verification of commands with non-parameter inputs
- Fix yamcs-web packaging issue
- Added a option dataPartitioningByTime to allow partitioning the tm, pp, events, alarms, cmdhistory tables and the parameter archive by time.


Version 5.9.1 released 6-March-2024
- Fixed a bug whereas Yamcs won't remember after the first restart that it stored the tm,pp and events table in a different RocksDB column family (option introduced in 5.9.0)


Version 5.9.0 released 5-March-2024
- Added activities and procedures services and improved the timeline service
- Reorganized the archive for improving performance:
   - Parameter Archive is stored on a separate column family "parameter-archive". The parameter-archive suffers frequent rebuilds and storing data in a different cf will leave other data undisturbed when the parameter archive rebuilds.
   - The tm,pp and events tables are stored on a separate column family "rt_data" - these tables are mostly append only and require "realtimeish" performance.
- Fix on-demand packet extraction in case of multiple on same timestamp
- Add CSP 1.x pre/post processors
- Add UdpTcTmDataLink for both TM and TC on a single socket pair
- Improve application properties: dashes allowed, nesting allowed, spaces allowed in fallback value
- Allow mapping verifier onSuccess/onFail/onTimeout from and to XTCE
- Improve support for returning values from a verifier
- Refresh OIDC tokens granted by external identity provider
- Add opt-in OIDC back-channel logout support
- Redirect to login following invalidation of the auth session
- Allow seeing arguments inline, directly on command history page
- Add ParameterListService for storing, and exporting lists of parameters
- Rework server-side algorithm API to better allow for both system logging, as well as publishing events.

Version 5.8.8 released 3-Nov-2023
- Add API call to stream MDB items

- Added cascading feature (one Yamcs downstream Yamcs server connecting to an upstream Yamcs server)
- Improved the replay capabilities in yamcs-web
- Various tweaks and fixes


Version 5.7.8 released 5-Oct-2022
- Fix for a case when CFDP service was configured with enableAtStartup: false. Before the fix, the service was still processing incoming PDUs.

Version 5.7.7 released 3-Oct-2022
- some fixes in the CFDP implementation:
 - when the FIN ACK is lost: the sender will keep sending FIN ACK for each FIN packet received (even if the transaction from the sender point of view is completed)
 - when the receiver is dead (or it does not acknowledge the EOF case). In that case Yamcs wanted to cancel the transaction but it got stuck
 - when the service is stopped, do not process incoming packets
- add support for (variable length) array command arguments (only one-dimensional arrays supported for now)
- various tweaks and fixes

Version 5.7.6 released 27-Jul-2022
- added a low priority option when subscribing via websocket. This allows the yamcs-web to keep connected if there is high incoming data rate, at the expense of some of the messages not displayed.
- bug fix parameter archive retrieval end conditions (sometimes it would send data that was past the stop time of the request)
- allow java algorithms to specify their input list (if for any reason is not available in the xtce definition)

Version 5.7.5 released 24-Jul-2022
- CFDP fixes
  - the pendingAfterCompletion parameter can be specified now
  - when starting a new download the number of pending downloads excludes the ones just finished and also the uploads. The number is used to compare with the maxNumberDownloads parameter - if the maximum would be exceeded a new download transfer would not be initiated and the respective PDU dropped


Version 5.7.4 released 15-Jun-2022
- added an option to the /api/stream-archive/{instance}:streamParameterValues (which extracts parameters using replays) to filter the packets based on the tm links  
on which they have been originally received.
 For example typically a different link is used to receive dump (recorded on-board) packets; This option can be used to extract parameters only from those. Or could be used to retrieve only from the realtime packets skipping the dump.

Version 5.7.3 released 9-Jun-2022
- CCSDS TM/TC randomizer: fixed the interpretation of offset/length parameters (may affect custom encoders which want to randomize/derandomzie only parts of the frames).
- Allow custom (Java) algorithms to provide the list of output parameters at runtime (rather than in the MDB definition) such that the algorithms are not skipped at replay time if no output parameter has been declared in the MDB def.
- MDB: added internal support for ToString allowing to define how to display the values of parameters (will be implemented in the future in yamcs-web and Yamcs Studio)
- yamcs-web:
  - Show favicon badge when there is an alarm
  - Add group action for queues
  - Show process tree on system page
  - Add Command detail page
)
Version 5.7.2 released 3-Jun-2022
- yamcs-web: fix render issue with enumerated and command aggregate arguments

Version 5.7.1 released 30-May-2022

- yamcs-client: fix generation of command source for command with binary arguments
- fixed units in the data links synthesized parameters (e.g. /yamcs/<hostname>/tm_realtime/packetRate)


Version 5.7.0 relased 27-May-2022
- implemented backend support for raw TCs (telecommands which are not generated from the mission database) and bypassing the postprocessor.
- Renamed several java packages to avoid having the same package in different jars (this practice has been discouraged since the introduction of java modules) 
  The "org.yamcs.xtceproc" and "org.yamcs.xtce" in yamcs-core has bene renamed to "org.yamcs.mdb". May require update of custom plugins if they use classes from those packages.
- Various tweaks and fixes


Version 5.6.2 released 11-Apr-2022
- Added support for Java 17 by using Nashorn javascript engine as a module

- Added possibility to trace algorithm executions.
- minor tweaks and fixes

Version 5.4.2 released 9-Mar-2021
- Fixed the container name used as partition in the tm table. XtceTmRecorder will only use as partition (pname column in the tm table) the containers directly inherited from the root container defined on the stream on which the TM packet is received. Previously, if a container included another container inside, this last one would have been used as partition and also appear as the name of the packet in the home page of yamcs-web.
- Added a maxValues parameter to the parameter range request
- Added an API for instance reconfiguration  - the instances created from templates can now be updated following template changes, or with modified template variables.
- Allow aggregate values (not only members) to be used in Java algorithms (not yet available in Python or Javascript algorithms - these have to make reference to aggregate members)
- minor tweaks and fixes

Version 5.4.1 released 17-Feb-2021
- CFDP: allow to configure the inactivityTimeout
- changed yamcs systemd script to not depend on bash being the system shell

- Added a simple PUS simulator to exemplify the usage of the time correlation (TCO) service with a free running on-board clock.
- Save the OBT (value of the free running on-board clock) in the tm table.
- TCP and UDP packet links populate the ERT (Earth Reception Time) field of the TM packets with the local mission time as this is required by the TCO service.

Version 5.3.2 released 11-Dec-2020
- Reorganized the service creation and initialization such that a pre-processor (which used to be initialized earlier) can have access to them.
- CfsPacketPreprocessor can optionally use the time correlation service to verify the time extracted from the packet.
- Removed the clock name from the time correlation service, use the serviceName instead.

Version 5.3.1 released 8-Dec-2020
- CFDP improvements
- minor tweaks and fixes

Version 5.3.0 released 25-Nov-2020
- Added a bulk load option to be used by the command yamcs tables load. It does not update the histograms and also disables the RocksDB WAL (write ahead log) resulting in faster loads.
  the histograms have to be rebuilt manually after this.
- Introduced a table format V3 which sorts properly the negative numbers and also the strings
   - most Yamcs tables use a timestamp as primary key and the timestamps before 1970 are represented as negative numbers and thus were not sorted properly
   - the old format V2 is still supported but new tables created with this Yamcs version will not be readable by a previous Yamcs vsersion.
- Preview feature: secondary indices on tables; not used for regular Yamcs tables (tm, events, cmd_history, etc) but it will be used for the soon to come Yamcs timeline.
- Preview feature: time correlation service; can be used to correlate a free running on-board clock with the ground time.
   - in case the on-board time is correlated using other means (e.g. on-board GPS receiver), the service can still be used for verifying the synchronization.
- Yamcs-web: show a preview of the evaluation of transmission constraints before sending a command 
- Yamcs-web: tables/streams are moved to admin section, and a web-based DB-shell is added
- Yamcs-web: packets can now be individually exported or copied to clipboard


Version 5.2.0 released 13-Oct-2020
- Allow all TM data links to update a simulation time if configured

- moved the simulator into its own package out of the examples (such that the examples are independent of eachother)
- changed the errorCorrection into errorDetection for TC frames (for consistency with TM links and also to documentation)
- added a parameter on CfsCommandPostprocessor to allow swaping between checksum and command code (necessary on little endian systems with older versions of cFS)
- added the possibility to specify patterns for the TC streams to define which command goes into which stream (before the way to do this was using some sql statements)
- various bugfixes

Version 5.0.0 released 3-Jul-2020
- migrated the .def table definitions into the rocksdb. 
  WARNING: the migration is automatic but once migrated the version 4 will not be able to read the data anymore! 
  (the data in the database is not changed, if absolutely necessary we can make a version 4.10.x that can read it)
- split Event and ParameterValue protobuf messages into internal and external. 
  The internal messages use Yamcs timestamps whereas the external messages use protobuf timestamps.
- changed the link configuration to be more consistent: removed the "args" parameter; 
  all the properties should be moved one level up.
- added a status bitfield on all packets where pre-processors can set specific flags such as:
  packet invalid
  local time used instead of spacecraft generation time extracted from packet
  do not archive
- implemented a replication service
- removed default yearly partitions for tm/pp data (can still be done by creating manually the tables)
- added an option to send raw frame data over streams (such that they can be monitored externally or saved into tables)
- CfsEventDecoder: added an option to specify byte endianess with default to big endian (used to be hardcoded to little endian)
                   added also an option for the charset used to decode the text string, default to US-ASCII
- removed yamcs-artemis (since it was used mainly for replication)
- removed the IndexServer:
    The CCSDS completeness index functionality is provided now by the CcsdsTmIndex service. 
    The histograms do not require definition of any extra service.
- yamcs-xtce: 
    all parameter and argument types need to be constructed through builders. 
    all data encodings need to be constructed through builders. 
    support the baseType XTCE property which allows a type to inherit properties from another type.
    AbsoluteTimeParameterType uses java Instant as initial value (rather than Yamcs times)
- remove the yamcs-simulation rpm. Simulation is one of the examples along others.
- updated RocksdDB to a newer version such that Yamcs can be run now on Windows 64bits and Linux ARM64 (e.g. Raspberry Pi 4)


Version 4.10.9 released 24-Apr-2020
- reorganized the links by removing the DataLinkInitializer and creating a LinkManager 
  that has more functionality, like for example being able to negatively acknowledge commands
  if all the TC links are disabled.
- add a filter box to Packet Viewer (thanks to QinetiQ Space)
- minor other tweaks and fixes

Version 4.10.8 released 28-Feb-2020

- For standalone parameters (i.e. not extracted from XTCE packets) coming without an enginnering value, 
  calibrate (raw->eng value) them inside the processor rather than before being injected in the stream.
  This means the parameters are stored in the L0 archive also in the initial form (could be raw+eng,only raw or only eng) and they are calibrated (using the current MDB) for each replay
  Of course ParameterArchive will store them calibrated.
- Added a command to check the configuration by loading the services without starting them

This contains an example that is functionally identical to `ccsds-frames`, but with the addition of SDLS encryption.
Encryption uses AES256-GCM (256-bit key, authenticated encryption).
The following frame types can be encrypted: TM, TC, AOS, USLP.
Encryption keys are configured on the data link level, and virtual channels on a link are associated with a particular key, by means of a Security Parameter Index (SPI, a number shared between the sender and the receiver).
On incoming links, multiple SPIs can be configured for a virtual channel.
Because we use a deterministic IV for AES-GCM, Yamcs implements sequence number persistence across sessions; the simulator does not, so it is configured to skip verifying the sequence number of the first frame it receives.
For the same reason, Yamcs by default does not verify the sequence number of incoming frames; this can be manually overridden if necessary.

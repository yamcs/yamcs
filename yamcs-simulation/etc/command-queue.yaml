# Definitions of command queues
# Eeach queue has a name, a default state and a list of roles
# There are three possibile states: 
#   - enabled means the commands are sent immediately
#   - blocked means the commands are accepted into the queue but need to be 
#     manually sent 
#   - disabled means the commands are rejected 
# There is always a commandqueue called "default". It can be  redefined here
# in order to have a different state
# If a command comes from a user which is not defined by any other queue, 
#   it is put into the default queue

Security
========


Yamcs includes a security subsystem which allows authenticating and authorizing users. Authentication is the act of identifying the user, whereas authorization involves determining what privileges this user has.

Once authorized, the user may be assigned one or more privileges that determine what actions the user can perform. Yamcs distinguishes between system privileges and object privileges.

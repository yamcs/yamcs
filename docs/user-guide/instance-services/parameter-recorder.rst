Parameter Recorder
==================

Records parameters. This service stores the data coming from one or more streams into a table ``pp``. The term *pp* stands for processed parameter. These are parameters that typically are processed by an external system before being recorded in Yamcs. It is also used to store system parameters that are generated by Yamcs itself.

.. note::
    Parameters extracted from packets are usually not stored in ``pp``. Instead Yamcs provides a different service called the :doc:`Parameter Archive <parameter-archive-service>` which is specially optimized for data retrieval.


Class Name
----------

:javadoc:`org.yamcs.archive.ParameterRecorder`


Configuration
-------------

This service is defined in ``etc/yamcs.(instance).yaml``. Example from a typical deployment:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: yamcs.simulator.yaml

    services:
      - class: org.yamcs.archive.ParameterRecorder

    streamConfig:
      param:
        - pp_realtime
        - sys_param

With this configuration both system parameters and processed parameters coming from the ``pp_realtime`` stream are stored into the table ``pp``.


Configuration Options
---------------------

streams (list of strings)
  The streams to record. When unspecified, all ``param`` streams defined in ``streamConfig`` are recorded.
